Why I chose to do

I just to take a part in Software development to use it as an advantage in the marketing industry. It is clear that over the past two decades, we have continuously evolved into a digital era.

I am very passionate when it comes to Marketing and after taking some courses on CodeAcademy, I realized that it was an area that needed more in depth concentration. This is when I started using research tools to see what schools were the best pick for someone who had never taken a dab at coding prior.
