Wow! Where to even start with this. I finally completed the project and I must say, while it seemed like it would be tough to begin with, this project was so much more than that. This project tied up all loose ends and reassured me of the material I was learning in a time where I very much needed reassurance. 

When i first started, I was afraid of the unknown. Where do I begin? What do I even do? I was about to forgo the videos provided and try to take it on all on my own, but thats when I stopped. There must be a reason why these videos are there right? So what the heck, I gave it a shot. And boy, am I glad I did! The CLI walk through video was very informative and Avi does a great job walking students through the crucial steps in setting up a CLI. 

I loved this project, as much as I ran into issues, with every issue I learned something new. I also realized I am definitely a more hands on learner in the sense that it took building a CLI gem from ground up to realy grasp the mechanics of object orientation and the role that scraping takes. 

Completing this project helped me retrace the steps through all the lessons from a simple task such as forking and cloning to a larger task such as building the controller and scraper methods.
