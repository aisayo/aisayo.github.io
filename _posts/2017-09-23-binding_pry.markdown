This week was major. Getting through these final projects after Ruby have me some what doubtful of my ability to code. But then an awesome tech coach showed me a great motivational video and it made me want to continue to try. So I chose a goal for the week and tackled it. I was very confused about the usage of binding.pry as I was not playing around and utilizing as much as I should have been. While on a screenshare, the tech coach told me learning how to use IRB and Binding.pry to my advantage would help exponentially. So i took some time out and really looked into how I should be using it. I am still a little weary on IRB, but I plan on tackling that next.
