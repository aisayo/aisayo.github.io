I just finished the Sinatra project last night and all I can say is Sinatra has definitely been an interesting category, in a good way. Starting Ruby was tough for me, my confidence levels in my absorbance of the material was at an all time low and I even began questioning if this is for me. And then comes Sinatra. 

Ruby had been such a tough ride that I was afraid of Sinatra, I was afraid the further I went into the curriculum, the more lost I would get. But that just was not the case. I enjoyed Sinatra a lot and it was a game changer for me. It taught me that I really do enjoy the design and building part of developing.  

The one thing I definitely want to dabble in a bit more in detail is SQL. I feel as though being very knowledgable in SQL and database structing and retrieval is vital in todays day and age with so much hacking occuring. I even foresee it as being a new hot career trend. 

So I started my Sinatra project wednesday night. I was prepping myself to spend at least a few days to a week on it as I did with the CLI. So I figured this time I will come into the project better prepared. I spent Wednesday night building out my project on paper, making sure to cover any questions I had, any confusions. I buit my RESTful routes, with the corresponding views as well as my models and database. I figured doing so would help smooth out any wrinkles and get the hard part over with. 

Thursday morning I began building the application. I ran into a little trouble figuring out how exactly to get started(I even accidently built my tree according the CLI procedure, oops). But with the help of a Learn instructor, I was able to install the gem Corneal which instantly builds a Sinatra tree(Directory). 

https://github.com/thebrianemory/corneal << For anyone who wants to use it, just enter gem install corneal into your terminal. It's great. It comes with a stylesheet and CSS that you can manipulate to your liking.

This helped tons, and I was on my way to coding my website. Now that was fun. Watching something you are building come alive and work is definitely rewarding. I even sent the server address to some friends and had them give it a go. 

The only issues I ran into were with my edit action. I had some funky code it was not liking so much that it would give me constant nomethod errors. So i took the code out and it ran smoothly. 

I really wanted to build an extra page that contained "traded candies" where the functionality is that users can display the candy they have in a page for grabs. I think I will be better suited to build multifunctional pages once I complete Rails and Javascript. 

My takeaway from the project was that I would love to learn more about adding graphics to pages, and playing with CSS. I messed around with it just a little but it wasnt very much. 

Below are some resources I found very helpful during my Sinatra journey:
