One of the biggest problems I seem to occuringly have is building the methods. I seem to do really well understanding the mechanisms of a method, however when I come across needing to iterate and use if/else statements, I get stuck.

As I slowly progress through the program, I am finding ways to puzzle the pieces together. I recently conquered working with IRB which was a major thing for me as it is now helping me practice the methods I am constructing.
